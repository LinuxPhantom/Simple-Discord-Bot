## Overview

Welcome to the Simple Discord Bot Tutorial! In this guide, we'll walk you through the process of creating your own Discord bot, complete with a custom status. The provided code will serve as a foundation for your bot, and you can easily expand its functionality by adding more code snippets to suit your needs.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure you have the following:

### 1. Discord Account

Create an account on [Discord](https://discord.com/) if you don't have one already.

### 2. Discord Developer Portal

Head to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) to create a new application and obtain your bot's token.

## Installation

To begin setting up your bot, open your command prompt and execute the following commands:

1. **Clone this repository to your local machine:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/LinuxPhantom/NameOfYourBot.git
   cd NameOfYourBot


# Initialize your project (optional):
	npm init
	
	
# Install the required dependencies:
	npm install discord.js
	
	
# Configuration
	Open the .env file in your bot's root directory and replace "YOUR_BOT_TOKEN" with your bot's token obtained from the Discord Developer Portal.
	
	
# Running the Bot
**Start your Discord bot by running the following command:**
  node .
	
	
# The bot should now be online on your Discord server!


## Customizing the Bot
